#rise.pollution-free-world..



A world of change, a world without pollution more so air pollution, a world without respiratory diseases due to toxic air , we all need such a world.

**INTRODUCTION**

I stand by the names of Wakabi Sydney and with great concern am here to unveil the greatest environmental destroyer and cause of most negative health conditions.

With great desire and hope to live in a pollution and disease free world, we, humans are coming up with different ways of conserving the environment order to make it a better place.
Implementing various ways of fighting water, land and air pollution, humanity comes up with advanced methods of taking action to reduce these kinds of pollution.
Pollution does not only affect the environment we live in but also affects our health and lifestyles. The main type of pollution we are going to look at is **Air pollution.**

**Air pollution is the introduction of toxic/harmful gases into the atmosphere.** This affects our health more so acute and chronic respiratory diseases, causes global warming, heart diseases, Neuropsychiatric complications, and so many other environmental damages as talked about in the **findings** below.

**FINDINGS**

**HUMAN HEALTH COMPLICATIONS**

Lung diseases

Severe toxic fume inhalations, usually accidental due to human error or equipment failure, can result in immediate death from asphyxia or cause mild to severe respiratory distress from acute upper airways inflammation, delayed pulmonary edema, respiratory muscle dysfunction, or a combination of illnesses. Most patients are expected to survive and recover with little or no residual dysfunction regardless of the severity of the initial event. However, in some cases disabling long-term sequelae, eg, bronchiectasis, chronic airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperreactivity, asthma-like disease (reactive airways dysfunction syndrome), bronchiolitis obliterans, or residual psychophysiologic dyspnea, can occur. 

Therapy of the respiratory effects of irritant gases should follow the general principles used for the treatment of upper and lower airway obstruction, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and hemorrhagic pneumonitis while spontaneous healing and recovery occurs, because no specific therapy is available for direct chemical pulmonary injury. Corticosteroids are frequently used and recommended, but their efficacy in altering the course and outcome of respiratory injury has not yet been properly documented.

Heart diseases

When you breathe in poor quality air, the air pollutants can travel deep into your bloodstream through your lungs, and to your heart. This can increase your risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases. 

    Damage your blood vessels by making them narrower and harder. This can:
        make it more difficult for your blood to flow freely
        make your blood more likely to clot
        increase your blood pressure because your heart is pumping faster to move the blood that can’t flow properly
        increase the strain on your heart muscle by working harder than it should.
    Affect your heart’s electrical system which controls your heartbeat. This can:
        cause abnormal heart rhythms.
    Potentially cause small changes to the structure of your heart. This can:
        be similar to changes seen in the early stages of heart failure.

For people with existing heart and circulatory conditions, this damage can increased their risk of events like a heart attack or stroke.

**ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLICATIONS**
**GLOBAL WARMING AND GREENHOUSE EFFECT**

**GREENHOUSE EFFECT**
The greenhouse effect is the process by which greenhouse gases(carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) in a planet's atmosphere cause some of the heat radiated from the planet's surface to build up within the planet's surface. When these gases rise up in the atnmosphere, they form a thermal blanket within the atmosphere
**Global warming**

What is global warming and its caused?

**Global warming** is an aspect of climate change, referring to the long-term rise of the planet's temperatures. It is caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, and farming. Global warming has effects on our environment and these include: Hotter temperatures. As greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global surface temperature. ...
More severe storms. ...
Increased drought. ...
A warming, rising ocean. ...
Loss of species. ...
Not enough food. ...
More health risks. ...
Poverty and displacement

The main effect of global warming is **climate change**. Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. whenever there is a change in climate, the environment is affected a lot which brings more comlcations to we the humans who reside on earth. some of the effects of climate change include;
More frequent and intense drought, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and warming oceans can directly harm animals, destroy the places they live, and wreak havoc on people's livelihoods and communities.

Acid Rain Can Cause Health Problems in People
Air pollution like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can cause respiratory diseases, or can make these diseases worse. Respiratory diseases like asthma or chronic bronchitis make it hard for people to breathe. The pollution that causes acid rain can also create tiny particles. When these particles get into people’s lungs, they can cause health problems, or can make existing health problems worse. Also, nitrogen oxides cause ground-level ozone. This ground-level ozone causes respiratory problems, like pneumonia and bronchitis, and can even cause permanent lung damage. The health effects that people have to worry about are not caused by the acid rain, but are caused when people breathe in these tiny particles or ozone. Swimming in an acidic lake or walking in an acidic puddle is no more harmful to people than swimming or walking in clean water.

Acid Rain Harms Forests
Acid rain can be extremely harmful to forests. Acid rain that seeps into the ground can dissolve nutrients, such as magnesium and calcium, that trees need to be healthy. Acid rain also causes aluminum to be released into the soil, which makes it difficult for trees to take up water. Trees that are located in mountainous regions at higher elevations, such as spruce or fir trees, are at greater risk because they are exposed to acidic clouds and fog, which contain greater amounts of acid than rain or snow. The acidic clouds and fog strip important nutrients from their leaves and needles. This loss of nutrients makes it easier for infections, insects, and cold weather to damage trees and forests.

Acid Rain Damages Lakes and Streams
Without pollution or acid rain, most lakes and streams would have a pH level near 6.5. Acid rain, however, has caused many lakes and streams in the northeast United States and certain other places to have much lower pH levels. In addition, aluminum that is released into the soil eventually ends up in lakes and streams. Unfortunately, this increase in acidity and aluminum levels can be deadly to aquatic wildlife, including phytoplankton, mayflies, rainbow trout, small mouth bass, frogs, spotted salamanders, crayfish, and other creatures that are part of the food web.

This problem can become much worse during heavy downpours of rain or when the snow begins to melt in the spring. These types of events are known as episodic acidification.

Acid Rain Damages Buildings and Objects
Acid rain can also have a damaging effect on many objects, including buildings, statues, monuments, and cars. The chemicals found in acid rain can cause paint to peel and stone statues to begin to appear old and worn down, which reduces their value and beauty.

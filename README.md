# rise.pollution-free-world
A world of change, a world without pollution more so air pollution, a world without respiratory diseases due to toxic air , we all need such a world.

**INTRODUCTION**

I stand by the names of Wakabi Sydney and with great concern am here to unveil the greatest environmental destroyer and cause of most negative health conditions.

With great desire and hope to live in a pollution and disease free world, we, humans are coming up with different ways of conserving the environment order to make it a better place.
Implementing various ways of fighting water, land and air pollution, humanity comes up with advanced methods of taking action to reduce these kinds of pollution.
Pollution does not only affect the environment we live in but also affects our health and lifestyles. The main type of pollution we are going to look at is **Air pollution.**

**Air pollution is the introduction of toxic/harmful gases into the atmosphere.** This affects our health more so acute and chronic respiratory diseases, causes global warming, heart diseases, Neuropsychiatric complications, and so many other environmental damages as talked about in the **findings** below.

**FINDINGS**

**HUMAN HEALTH COMPLICATIONS**
Severe toxic fume inhalations, usually accidental due to human error or equipment failure, can result in immediate death from asphyxia or cause mild to severe respiratory distress from acute upper airways inflammation, delayed pulmonary edema, respiratory muscle dysfunction, or a combination of illnesses. Most patients are expected to survive and recover with little or no residual dysfunction regardless of the severity of the initial event. However, in some cases disabling long-term sequelae, eg, bronchiectasis, chronic airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperreactivity, asthma-like disease (reactive airways dysfunction syndrome), bronchiolitis obliterans, or residual psychophysiologic dyspnea, can occur. 

Therapy of the respiratory effects of irritant gases should follow the general principles used for the treatment of upper and lower airway obstruction, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and hemorrhagic pneumonitis while spontaneous healing and recovery occurs, because no specific therapy is available for direct chemical pulmonary injury. Corticosteroids are frequently used and recommended, but their efficacy in altering the course and outcome of respiratory injury has not yet been properly documented.

**ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLICATIONS**

Global warming

What is global warming and its caused?

**Global warming** is an aspect of climate change, referring to the long-term rise of the planet's temperatures. It is caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, and farming. Global warming has effects on our environment and these include: Hotter temperatures. As greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global surface temperature. ...
More severe storms. ...
Increased drought. ...
A warming, rising ocean. ...
Loss of species. ...
Not enough food. ...
More health risks. ...
Poverty and displacement
